# Todo App
This is based upon the courses I took at https://courses.iamtimcorey.com as well as my own experience with these technologies

# Technologies
* Blazor Web App using new .NET 8 Interactive Server option (BlazorApiClient)
* Generated OpenAPI Project (Named BlazorApiGeneratedClient)
* Asp.NET Core Web Api (TodoApi)
* Sql Server generated by Database Project using Sql for Table and Stored Procedures (TodoDb)
* Swagger Enhancements including appearance and integrated Authentication button
* Uses https://github.com/ostranme/swagger-ui-themes for Swagger appearance
* Web Controller version support

  # Setup Secrets File
  * You will need to create a secrets file for the TodoApi project with the following entries
    {
      "Authentication": {
        "SecretKey": "<KEYHERE>",
        "Issuer": "https://localhost:7046",
        "Audience": "TodoApi"
      },
      "ConnectionStrings": {
        "Default": "<CONNECTION STRING HERE>"
      }
    }
  # User login for blazor
  There are currently 3 users that are set in the AuthorizationController in method ValidateCredentials. Feel free to use them or change to different ones if you like.
